# FCC-Image-Search-Abstraction-Layer

**Objective:** Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10 and browse recent search queries like this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/. Then deploy it to Glitch.
#### User stories:
  1. I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
  2. I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
  3. I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
